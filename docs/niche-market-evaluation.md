# Niche Market Evaluation: Where to Start

## Criteria

Every market is scored 1-5 on four dimensions:

| Criteria | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Informality** | Transactions happen in DMs, not on platforms. No structure. |
| **Unserved Pain** | No existing platform solves the trust/payment problem. |
| **Niche + Active** | Small community but high engagement and transaction velocity. |
| **Tech-Driven / No Alternative** | Users are tech-savvy AND have no choice but to adopt a new tool. |

## Tier 1: Strongest Fit

### 1. Mechanical Keyboard Group Buys

**Why it scores highest on "no alternative":**

There is literally no escrow product for group buys with 6-24 month production timelines. PayPal buyer protection expires at 180 days. By the time a keyboard ships, you have zero recourse. This is a structural problem that cannot be solved by existing payment rails.

**The community:**
- r/mechmarket: 298,000 members
- MechKeys Discord: 46,671 members
- GeekHack: Active since 2008, hundreds of concurrent group buys
- [keyboard.rip](https://keyboard.rip) — a community-maintained graveyard of failed group buys

**The pain:**
- **IvanIvanovich** — GeekHack moderator who ran multiple GBs, collected money, never paid manufacturers. GMK and RS Keyboards confirmed zero payment received. PayPal protection had expired. Buyers lost everything.
- **Vala Supply (2023-2024)** — Over a year late on shipping. Product shipped to other vendors but not to paying customers. Went silent. Exit scam.
- **Kono Store (2025)** — Major vendor, financial collapse. GMK had manufactured keycaps but received no payment. Third party (Apos) stepped in to fulfill orders. GMK absorbed production costs.

**Market size:**
- Custom keyboard market: $1.6B (2025), growing 15% CAGR
- GMK keycap sets: $200-300 each
- Custom keyboard builds: $200-600
- Individual GBs collect $10K-$500K+ from participants

**Transaction pattern:**
- Buyer pays $200-600 upfront
- Waits 6-24 months
- Receives product (hopefully)
- No protection after PayPal's 180-day window

**Why escrow is the exact solution:**
- Funds held in escrow from day 1
- Released to organizer only when manufacturer ships
- Or milestone-based: release partial on MOQ confirmation, partial on production complete, remainder on delivery
- Auto-refund if organizer goes dark

**Weakness:** Low frequency per person (2-5 GBs per year). But high dollar value per transaction.

**Tech-savviness:** 5/5. These are people who solder PCBs and flash custom firmware. They will adopt a crypto-backed tool without blinking.

---

### 2. AI Model / LoRA Trading

**Why it scores highest on "no alternative":**

In May 2025, Visa and Mastercard paused payment processing on Civitai (the largest AI model marketplace, 5M monthly users) due to adult content concerns. The community literally lost their payment rails overnight. They're now using USDT, ETH, ACH, and gift codes as workarounds. A stablecoin payment link is their natural next step.

**The community:**
- Civitai: 5M monthly active users, 22.57M website visits/month
- Discord communities for model trading
- Hugging Face: Broader AI model ecosystem

**The pain:**
- **Payment processing broken**: Credit cards paused. Community forced into crypto already.
- **Model theft rampant**: Platforms like SeaArt.ai accused of stealing LoRAs from Civitai.
- **Copyright chaos**: LoRAs trained on copyrighted art without consent. No verification.
- **No creator protection**: Models can be downloaded and redistributed freely.

**Transaction pattern:**
- Creator publishes LoRA/model
- Buyer pays per-model or subscription
- Typical: $1-10 per model (low), but custom commissions: $50-500+
- Creator earned $1,000+ in 3 months with 251 customers in one documented case

**Why escrow fits:**
- Custom LoRA commissions (trained on specific style/character) are the high-value use case
- Client pays for custom training → funds held → creator delivers model → funds release
- Solves both the "will they deliver" and "will they pay" problem

**Weakness:** Per-model transactions are very small ($1-10). The opportunity is in custom commissions, not commodity models. Also, the copyright/content policy landscape is chaotic and could change regulatory posture.

**Tech-savviness:** 5/5. The most tech-forward audience possible. They're already using crypto out of necessity.

---

## Tier 2: Strong Fit With Caveats

### 3. FPV Drone Group Buys

**Why it scores high:**

No formal group buy infrastructure exists at all. Zero search results for any organized platform. The community coordinates bulk purchases from Chinese suppliers entirely through Discord DMs. Organizers collect money manually.

**The community:**
- Drone Community Discord: 14,885 members
- Smaller but extremely engaged
- Budget-oriented (complete drone for ~$100)

**Why it falls short:** Community is too small. 14.8K members vs. 298K for mech keyboards. Not enough transaction volume to build a network.

---

### 4. Cosplay Commissions

**Why it scores high on informality:**

100% DM-based. No dedicated platform exists. Instagram DMs, Discord, DeviantArt notes. PayPal is the only payment method. Zero buyer or seller protection.

**The community:**
- Global cosplay market: $2.5B+ (2025)
- Sob story scam epidemic: 10+ fake accounts per day on Discord with AI portfolios
- PayPal chargeback fraud is rampant

**Why it falls short on "tech-driven":** The cosplay community isn't particularly tech-forward. Asking cosplayers to use an agentic payment link backed by stablecoin escrow is a UX mismatch. They want simplicity — Venmo, not crypto.

---

### 5. Digital Art Commissions

**Why it almost made Tier 1:**

Massive community (260K+ Discord servers), 30%+ artists experience scams, 72% ghosted. The pain is real and frequent.

**Why it didn't:**

Escrow platforms already exist:
- **Artconomy** (since 2018) — Shield escrow, chargeback protection, order management
- **VGen** (2023) — 5% fee, Skeb-like, growing in VTuber/anime community
- **Skeb** (Japan) — 3.2M users, 170K+ creators, 10-20% monthly growth

The problem isn't that no solution exists. The problem is adoption. That's a marketing challenge, not a product opportunity.

---

## Tier 3: Already Served (Less Opportunity)

### 6. Trading Card Group Breaks

**Competition is increasing:**
- Whatnot: $6B GMV, dominant platform
- Breaker Toolbox: Commission-free platform launched April 2025
- Fanatics Live: 6-12% fees, backed by Fanatics
- eBay Live: Growing, 13.25% fees (promos reduce to ~6.6%)

**Regulatory risk:** FTC complaints filed. Breaks described as "unregulated gambling." Loot box precedent (Genshin Impact $20M settlement). Classification risk could reshape the entire market.

The pain is real but solutions are multiplying. You'd be entering a market where incumbents are actively competing on fees.

### 7. Gaming Accounts / Skins

**Multiple escrow platforms exist:**
- Buff163: 2.5% fee, escrow
- CSFloat: 2% fee, P2P with auto-verification
- DMarket: 4.4/5 Trustpilot, 29K reviews
- PlayerAuctions, Eldorado, G2G, Scrowise, AccFuse, Tradeswp

Steam's July 2025 Trade Protection update (7-day reversal window) further changed the landscape. Platforms are adapting.

### 8. Roblox UGC Trading

Roblox has its own marketplace with built-in trading. The pain (40-50% resale tax) is real but it's a platform governance issue, not an infrastructure gap. Building outside Roblox's ecosystem risks TOS enforcement.

## Decision Framework

**If you want the strongest product-market fit** (problem that literally cannot be solved by existing tools):

> **Mechanical Keyboard Group Buys** — PayPal's 180-day protection window makes long-timeline escrow impossible on existing rails. Smart contract escrow with milestone releases is the only solution. The community is tech-savvy enough to adopt it. The dollar values ($200-600/transaction) justify the friction.

**If you want the most urgent, forced adoption** (community has no choice):

> **AI Model / LoRA Trading** — Visa/MC pulled payment processing. 5M users lost their payment rails. They're already using crypto as a workaround. You'd be formalizing what they're already doing informally. But transaction sizes are small unless you focus on custom commissions.

**If you want the largest addressable community with the simplest escrow logic:**

> **Trading Card Group Breaks** — Biggest community, highest frequency, simplest transaction (money in → cards out). But competition from Whatnot, Breaker Toolbox, and Fanatics Live is intensifying, and regulatory risk looms.

---

## Recommendation

**Start with Mechanical Keyboard Group Buys.**

Here's why, through the beanie baby lens:

| Beanie babies for eBay | Mech keyboard GBs for Niche |
|---|---|
| Obsessive collectors | Obsessive enthusiasts |
| Traded frequently in a small community | GBs run constantly on GeekHack/Discord |
| Trust was the core problem | Trust is THE problem (6-24 month waits) |
| eBay's feedback system was the unlock | Milestone escrow is the unlock |
| Small market that proved the platform | $1.6B market that proves the payment tool |
| Led to broader e-commerce | Leads to broader P2P escrow for any GB |

The keyboard community is:
- **Small enough to dominate** (~300K active traders)
- **Tech-savvy enough to adopt** (they flash firmware and solder PCBs)
- **In enough pain to switch** (keyboard.rip is a graveyard of lost money)
- **Completely unserved** (no escrow exists for 6+ month timelines)
- **High enough transaction values** ($200-600) to justify the tool

And the expansion path is clear: mech keyboards → any group buy with a long timeline (artisan keycaps, custom PCBs, indie electronics, FPV drones) → any P2P escrow transaction.
